        <p class="main-greeting"> My Bio Section</p>
        <p class="main-name"> As an active person, I plan to eagerly get involved in but not limited to local Business associations, Chamber of Commerce, and Rotary of America. These have proved excellent networking opportunities for me before. I enjoy Art, History and Music going to church and reading everyday, and some outdoor sports.
            As a professional, I genuinely enjoy the facets of working with a team and being a team player. In College I was President of the inter-club Council, for 5 years now I have worked in all facets of Business and Sales except finance which I have a strong desire to learn and expand my knowledge. I also have experience-managing employees. My goals are to obtain my work for a progressive company. I will dedicate my time and effort to constantly seeking council and executing new sales techniques.</p>
